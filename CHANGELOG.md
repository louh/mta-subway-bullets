# v1.0.0

- **ðŸš¨ BREAKING CHANGES! ðŸš¨**
  - Modernized build pipeline (no longer depends on Gulp).
  - **New:** optimized SVGs (via SVGO) are now provided as part of the package.
  - **New:** optimizing PNGs is now part of the build command, rather than a separate step.
  - All optimized SVGs and PNGs have been moved into respective folders in `dist` (formerly `build`). This will break file paths if you were importing directly from the package.
  - Source SVGs and build scripts are now located in `src` (formerly `source` or did not exist). Source SVGs are uncompressed but continue to be provided with the package anyway in case you need to use them.
  - Source image in Affinity Designer format updated to use v2.
- Fixed the F diamond bullet not appearing in the symbol bundle (`icons.svg`)
